import ContentBox from "@/components/mdx-example/content-box";

# MDX: Using imports

Create a new page within the /app directory and an MDX file wherever you'd like:

```
  my-project
  ├── app
  │   └── mdx-page
  │       └── page.(tsx/js)
  ├── content
  │   └── using-import.(mdx/md)
  |── mdx-components.(tsx/js)
  └── package.json
```

You can use MDX in these files, and even import React components, directly inside your MDX page:

Import the MDX file inside the page to display the content:

```
import React from "react";
import Content from "@/content/using-imports.mdx";

const Page = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Content />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Checkout my React component:

<ContentBox />
